# js-project-boilerplate
A simple Node + React project boilerplate

## Why?
I found create-react-app is great for getting a small project started, but the amount of abstraction it has makes extending the config difficult as the project grows.
This serves as a starting point for a new project with a Node.js backend and React.js frontend.

## How to use?
- Clone this repo
- Change the remote branch
- Run `yarn start`
