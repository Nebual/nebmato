A basic Stopwatch/Timer, with quick add/subtract minutes buttons

## Why?
When working from home, distractions abound, and workdays can blur together.

I run my stopwatch when I'm working, and pause it when I make lunch, or get 
distracted by roommates. When I inevitably forget to stop it, or forget to 
start it again, this Timer can quickly add or remove 20m. If my time's a bit 
low by 5:30pm, I'll pick it back up at 11pm when distractions are asleep.

## How to use?
- Run `yarn && yarn start`
- Or `yarn build` and open `dist/index.html` in your browser
